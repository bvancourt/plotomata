# Plotomata
The overall goal of this package is to generate publication quality/style plots in a way that minimizes non-reuseable code. To accomplish this, plotomata provides plotting functions that can accept data in a variety of formats, and provides a more useable interface for some functionality of Matplotlib with more dynamic defualt behavior. It is intended to be equally useable either directly in Python or from R using reticulate.

This project is currently at a very early stage of development with limited functionality.
